**Real-time data stream processing**

I. Elements of Case Study  
What is Case Study: investigating trends and specific situations in scientific disciplines  

1. The Problem  
	i.  Identify the problem  
	ii. Explain why the problem is important  
	iii.How was the problem identified?  
	iv. Was the process for identifying the problem effective?  

2. Steps taken to address the problem  

3. Results  

4. Challenges and how they were met  

5. Beyond Results  

6. Lessons Learned  

II. Background information  

1. What is stream processing?  
   a method of continuous computation that happens as data is flowing through the system.  

2. What is real-time system?  
   has tight deadlines  
   low-latency  

3. Sourses of data using stream processing  
   Sensors  
   Web feeds  
   Social networking  

4. Use cases of stream processing  
   business intelligence  
   real time data analysis  
   trends detection  
   smart order routing  
   log processing  
   real time stock quotes  
   fraud detection  
   Route Planning  

5. Real-time stream processing tools  
   storm: a distributed computation framework for event stream processing, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing.  
   spark(streaming's batch processing):	can be seen as a potential replacement for the MapReduce functions of Hadoop
